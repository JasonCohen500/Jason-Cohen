# Jason-Cohen
I am precisely described as a tech junkie working in content development and marketing for a thriving start-up: &lt;a href="https://stafftimerapp.com" target="_blank">Stafftimer App&lt;/a>. Literature lover by default. My interests range from politics to social issues, books to tech trends, gadgets and so on.
